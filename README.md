### Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

### What is submitted

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. I have create a report describing how I built my model, how I used cross validation, and why I made the choice. I will be using my  prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

### Data

The training data for this project are available here:

The test data are available here:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

### Question

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: 
+ exactly according to the specification (Class A), 
+ throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), 
+ lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), 
+ lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and 
+ throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.

By processing data gathered from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of the participants in a machine learning algorithm, the question is can the appropriate activity quality (class A-E) be predicted?
